Amazon Price Checker Python Project

This is a web scraping project that checks the prices of the first 10 products from an Amazon search for 'Amazon Fire TV'. The script is scheduled to run the price checker every minute (60s) but it can be adjusted to run every hour or day.

The Python Script (amazon_price_checker.py) and the csv extract (price_extract.csv) are attached.
